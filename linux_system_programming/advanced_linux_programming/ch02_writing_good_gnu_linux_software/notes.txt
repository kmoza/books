To specify the available long options, you construct an array of struct option elements. Each element corresponds to one long option and has four fields. In normal circumstances, the first field is the name of the long option (as a character string, without the two hyphens); the second is 1 if the option takes an argument, or 0 otherwise; the third is NULL; and the fourth is a character constant specifying the short option synonym for that long option.The last element of the array should be all zeros.
