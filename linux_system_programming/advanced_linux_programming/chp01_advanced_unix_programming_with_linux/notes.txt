Chapter 1
- some intro to emacs and its exceptional features
- much of emacs in written in LISP
- The -c option tells g++ to compile the program to an object file
- The -I option is used to tell GCC where to search for header files.
- GCC has several different levels of optimization; the second level is appropriate for most programs.
- You should always use g++ to link a program that contains C++ code, even if it also contains C code.
- The compiler automatically adds the lib prefix and the .a suffix. (compiling with libs)
- As with header files, the linker looks for libraries in some standard places, including the /lib and /usr/lib directories that contain the standard system libraries.
